If any **Hackathons for Schools Association** participants violate these rules, their teacher will be contacted and their school may wish to take further action. 
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact anyone at a **Hackathons for Schools Association** Member Event. They will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.
