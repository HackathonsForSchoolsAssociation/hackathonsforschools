## Who are we?

At **Hackathons for School** our mission is to improve the technology opportunities in schools, and to introduce more 15 to 18-year-olds to the world of hackathons and technology. We are a group of students who study STEM subjects at universities in the UK.

## What can we offer you?

Through our events we have the unique opportunity to open studentâ€™s eyes to the world of technology. A large part of this is showcasing exciting products and how they can use them to solve problems. We can also inform them of the different pathways for a career in technology ranging from work experience to school leaver schemes and apprenticeships.

As relatively recent school leavers ourselves we have seen first-hand that opportunities within technology were not well advertised to us, and we would like to do something about that.

## How can you help us?

As a community focussed non-profit organisation, we are committed to using all of our resources in the pursuit of our goals. This is not something we can do on our own, which is why we would love to partner with you!

There are a number of ways in which you can help us, these could include: providing some cool kit for students to use during a hackathon; financial support so we can reach students in a wider range of locations; or a completely bespoke deal!
