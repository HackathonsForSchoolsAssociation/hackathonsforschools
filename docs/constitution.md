The following document is the constitution for the **Hackathons for Schools Association**. **Hackathons for Schools Association** is an Unincorporated Association and will sometimes be referred to as **HFSA** throughout this document.

## Aims

The aims of Hackathons for Schools Association are as follows:

- To involve more under-18s in the hackathon community - primarily focussed on the UK community.
- To introduce under-18s to the prospect of careers in technology.
- To further diversify the technology and hackathon communities.

## Roles

There are two role categories for the **Hackathons for Schools Association**. Volunteers can be a Mentor, or a member of the core organisational team, referred to as the Core Team. Members of the Core Team are encouraged to take part in mentorship activities too. The responsibilities of mentors are mainly attending events where they will be helping the students gain the best experience as well as running workshops. Members of the Core Team have added responsibility, including maintenance of the website, creation of workshops to be delivered and establishing relationships with schools and partnering companies.

Anyone who wishes to join as a Mentor should make this known to the Core Team. Joining the Core Team is not currently an option but will be considered where deemed necessary.

Anyone can leave the Hackathons for Schools Association at any time and should make this known to the Core Team. Members may be asked to leave if a majority of the Core Team members believe that they are not acting in a way which is explicitly against the aims of the association.


## Equal Opportunities

As community builders, we firmly believe in ensuring that all people have the same opportunities available to them regardless of who they are. More information on this can be found in our [_Equal Opportunities Document_](/docs/equal-opportunities).

## Meetings

As an unincorporated association, we will be required to hold an Annual General Meeting, or AGM for short. This meeting will be used to inform all members of the status of the group, as well as making any changes to the constitution if required, occurring at the start of the academic year.
This meeting will be carried out over a voice call, and all members will be notified of the details 4 weeks in advance using the Discord chat server. Members can submit items for discussion any time until 1 hour before the meeting. In order to provide some flexibility, the maximum time between AGMs is 15 months. In order to make decisions, a quorum of 2 people must be present to represent the whole association.


## Finances

Finances for the **Hackathons for Schools Association** will be managed by the Core Team, who will be required to approve all expenditure on behalf of **HFSA**. All financial transactions involving **HFSA** must be recorded. This will primarily include travel to events where the member is representing **HFSA**. Only standard-class travel will be paid for, but a member can choose to upgrade if they are willing to pay the difference.

## Changes to the Constitution

Changes can be made to the constitution by voting on it. A suggestion should be raised with the Core Team, who are then able to arrange a way for all members to voice their opinion and vote on the inclusion of the amendment.

## Dissolution of the Hackathons for Schools Association

In order for **HFSA** to be dissolved, the following procedure must be followed:
- Members notified of a Special General Meeting.
- Members must vote on whether the dissolution will go ahead, a majority must be reached.
- Finances must be in order:
    - Members must all be reimbursed for agreed expenditure.
    - Remaining money should be given to a group with aims in line with those of the **HFSA**.
