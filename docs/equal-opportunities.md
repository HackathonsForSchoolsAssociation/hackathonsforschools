At **Hackathons for Schools Association**, we aim to create an environment that is free from discrimination and harassment in any form, in which all volunteers, students and teachers are treated with dignity and respect. **Hackathons for Schools Association** will not unlawfully discriminate in the arrangements we make for the selection of volunteers or in the opportunities we provide to schools. All decisions will be made fairly and objectively. We aim, as far as reasonably practicable, to ensure that all our practices are applied fairly and consistently and, where necessary, we will take reasonable steps to avoid or overcome any particular disadvantage these may cause and to promote equality. **Hackathons for Schools Association** commits to creating a friendly environment free of bullying, harassment, victimisation and unlawful discrimination, promoting dignity and respect for all, and where individual differences and the contributions of all volunteers are recognised and valued.

The aim is for our mentors, core team and the students we work with to be truly representative of all sections of society and for each volunteer to feel respected and able to give their best.

The policy's purpose is to:

- Provide equality, fairness and respect for all in our interactions, whether that is with mentors, students or teachers

-  Take seriously complaints of bullying, harassment, victimisation and unlawful discrimination by mentors, students, teachers, and any others in the course of Hackathons for Schools activities. Such acts will be dealt with as misconduct (see Hackathons for Schools Code of Conduct) and any appropriate action will be taken.
