# Who are we?
We are a passionate group of students who study STEM subjects at universities around the country.

# What are we doing?
Our goal is to improve the technology opportunities in schools, and get more students between the ages of 15 and 18 involved with hackathons.

# What is a hackathon?
A hackathon is an event when a group of like-minded people come together to solve problems. 'Hacking', despite its connotations, does not have to involve technology - just creating problem solving - and should not be malicious in nature.

# Why are hackathons important?
First of all, hackathons are great fun for all involved, and very rewarding for organisers and participants alike. Secondly, they open participants' eyes to new career options (in an ever growing field). Thirdly, they make for a great talking point for interviews of all kinds - especially for the common "Talk about a time when you worked in a team" type questions!

# Why should your school get involved?
Hackathons in general are a great way to meet and work with new people, and a great way to try something new. Following on from this, there is absolutely no expectation of prior programming ability so taking part in hackathons is a great way of getting involved with the world of Computer Science!
