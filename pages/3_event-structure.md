# What kind of workshops could be run?
Workshops could be run either by a teacher, or one of our fantastic mentors. They provide a great source of insipration for the students taking part in the hackathon, so we recommend running a workshop with content which can easily be replicated by the students.

The optimal environment for running a workshop would be in separate room to the main event space, perhaps in another classroom.

For inspiration when designing your workshop, please check out our resources list where you will be able to find a number of examples created by the team.

# Other mini-events
In order to break up the day, we highly recommend including a few smaller events in your schedule. These could include:
- Games
- Short competitions (programming based or not)
- Talks from guest speakers
