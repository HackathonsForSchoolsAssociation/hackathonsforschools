In order to break up the day, we highly recommend including a few smaller mini games during your hackathon.

## Cup Stacking

The aim is to build the tallest tower using cups.

Our friends at Major League Hacking have a [helpful guide](https://guide.mlh.io/Organizer-Resources/Cup-Stacking.html) to help you get started.

## Spaghetti Towers

The aim is to build the tallest tower using only dry spaghetti and marshmellows.

Our friends at STEM Learning have a [great guide](https://www.stem.org.uk/resources/elibrary/resource/34191/spaghetti-towers) on this!
