## Frequently Asked Questions

There's a lot of confusing terminology in technology, making it hard to understand whether your child is safe. We've outlined the most common questions asked to help clear things up.

### What is a hackathon?

Hackathon isn't the best way to describe the event. Instead, think of a hackathon as a **Invention Marathon**. Your child won't be breaking into things, but instead creating interesting projects through programming. We'll be teaching them about programming, working in teams, and how to solve problems.

### Is my child breaking the law by "Hacking"?

The only hacking we are doing is ethical! It also isn't like the kind of hacking that you would see on the news - here the term *hacking*
refers to creating something and solving problems. Most of the hacking we do is hacking together ideas into a working project. 

### My child hasn't done any programming before, how can they get started?

Our Member Events are for anyone, no matter your experience. We will have at least one of our [mentors](/mentors/) on site throughout the event to help students get started, and help them create their ideas.
