- Ensuring school network doesn't block specific sites.

## Installing Python on school computers

## Alternatively, use [repl.it](https://repl.it/ "repl.it")

repl.it is an online programming environment where you can build, test and debug your code. It has support for many libraries and
languages; and best of all, is entirely web based, so no need to install anything on the school computers.

## Setting up the school network

We often find that school networks block sites and libraries which we like to use for our workshops. Before running an event we will
liase with you to find out what we can and can't do to minimise potential issues on the day of the event.
