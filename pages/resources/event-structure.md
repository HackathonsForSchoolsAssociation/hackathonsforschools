# What kind of workshops could be run?
Workshops could be run either by a teacher, or one of our fantastic mentors. They provide a great source of insipration for the students taking part in the hackathon, so we recommend running a workshop with content which can easily be replicated by the students.

The optimal environment for running a workshop would be in separate room to the main event space, perhaps in another classroom.

For inspiration when designing your workshop, please check out our resources list where you will be able to find a number of examples created by the team.

# Other mini-events

It's important to break up your day, giving the students a break and keeping them engaged. We've got a list of [mini games](/resources/mini-games/) you can put into your schedule to help break up your day.

- Games
- Short competitions (programming based or not)
- Talks from guest speakers
